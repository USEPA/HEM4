Select 'Yes' if there is a 'Y' in your Facility List Options file in the dep or depl column(s) for any facility. Selecting 'Yes' will allow you to enter your deposition/depletion input files on the next screen. Deposition will only be modeled if there is a 'Y' in the dep column. Depletion will only be modeled if there is a 'Y' in the depl column. If you do not wish to model deposition or depletion there should be a blank or an 'N' in the dep and depl columns for all facilities and 'No' should be selected here.
