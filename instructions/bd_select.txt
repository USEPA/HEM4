Select 'Yes' if there is a 'Y' in your Facility List Options file in the bldg_dw column for any facility. Selecting 'Yes' will allow you to enter your building dimensions input file below, but building downwash will only be modeled if there is a 'Y' in the bldg_dw column. If you do not wish to model building downwash there should be a blank or an 'N' in the bldg_dw column for all facilities and 'No' should be selected.
