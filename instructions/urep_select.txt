Select 'Yes' if there is a 'Y' in your Facility List Options file in the user_rcpt column for any facility. Selecting 'Yes' here will allow you to enter your user receptor input file below, but user receptors will only be modeled if there is a 'Y' in the user_rcpt column. If you do not wish to model with user receptors there should be a blank or an 'N' in the user_rcpt column for all facilities and 'No' should be selected.
