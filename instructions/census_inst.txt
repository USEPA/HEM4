The HEM4 model can be based on either Census 2000 or Census 2010 data, however these years must not be mixed and matched (if, for example, your modeling effort requires multiple HEM4 runs). That is, the Census key file and all state Census files required to model the facilities of interest must be either 2000 or 2010 Census (not both). Note: When using Census 2000, Multi HEM4 defaults to a rural dispersion environment unless the user specifies 'U' for urban in the Facility List Options file and provides an urban popoulation in the 'Urban Population' column. When using Census 2010, the 'Default' (or blank) dispersion option in the Facility List Options file directs Multi HEM4 to assign the dispersion environment as either rural or urban based on whether emission sources are located in an area designated by Census 2010 as urban. Multi HEM4 will also provide the urban population number if needed under the 'Default' option.
